# HTML

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

HTML is the foundation of a webpage. It provides the structure and content of the page.
* Purpose: Defines the layout and elements on the page (e.g., headings, paragraphs, images, links, buttons).
* Analogy: Think of HTML as the skeleton of a house—it gives it shape and defines where things go.

# JavaScript & React & Next.js & TypeScript & Node.js

JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.

JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.

JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.

JavaScript makes a webpage interactive and adds dynamic behavior.
* Purpose: Adds functionality like responding to user actions, updating content without reloading, and more.
* Analogy: JavaScript is like the electrical wiring and appliances in a house—it makes things work, like turning on the lights.

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.

React is a User Interface (UI) library.

React is a tool for building UI components.

Vanilla JavaScript is primarily an imperative programming language, while React is an example of a framework that employs a declarative programming style. 

Imperative programming is a style where you write code that explicitly tells the computer how to perform tasks step by step. You directly manage the program’s state and the sequence of instructions.
* Focus: The how — the steps needed to achieve a result.
* Example: Manipulating the DOM in vanilla JavaScript.

Declarative programming focuses on describing what you want the outcome to be, leaving the underlying system (like React) to figure out how to implement it. You declare the desired UI state, and the framework handles updating the DOM efficiently.
* Focus: The what — the end result or the desired state.
* Example: Creating a component in React.

_Notes:_
* Imperative: Writing detailed step-by-step instructions for cooking a meal (e.g., “chop the vegetables, heat the pan, add oil”).
* Declarative: Ordering a meal by describing what you want (e.g., “I’d like a vegetable stir-fry”). The kitchen (React) takes care of the rest.
