            <h3>Coat</h3>
            <p>The Poodle's curly, dense single layer coat is considered hair—not fur as in most dogs. If left unclipped and unbrushed, the Poodle's coat will cord—or form dreadlocks. They shed minimally and are considered hypoallergenic. </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>Protective</h3>
            <p>The Poodle is not an aggressive breed, though they do exhibit some protective behaviors. They are likely to bark at strangers and would make a good watchdog.</p>

            <h3>Energy Levels</h3>
            <p>The athletic Poodle has boundless energy and enjoy activities that allow them to jump, bounce, and play. This breed is happiest when provided with tasks that exercise both body and mind.</p>
